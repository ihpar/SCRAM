** Testing **

- You will need to copy this folder (SimpleSCRAM) to htdocs directory,
- Run Apache Server
- Start Google Chrome and go to http://localhost/SimpleSCRAM/
- This version is using the test vectors fetched from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802#page-9
- Calculated scram values and authentication results can be inspected vie Chrome's JS Console.
- User name: user, password:pencil


** If everything goes fine, you should see something similar to all_is_well.png, which is included in this folder.
